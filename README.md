# Markov_Chain_Chord_Progressions

As formula-based music can be, there is also randomness involved. The possibility of any note is equally likely.
The Markov Property can be applied to music in the sense that while a note is random, it may depend only on the current note being played in a sequence. 

For this project, I chose to compare two of my favorite artists by their chord progression usage.
I chose the songs “Playing with Fire” and “Lovesick Girls” by Blackpink and “Landslide” and “Dreams” by Fleetwood Mac. 

Using R, I computed the transition probability matrices for each artist.

I gathered chord progressions through the sites Chordify and HookTheory (cited in report below), and I constructed a vector of chords in R attributing to each song by each artist. I then computed the transition probability matrices for each artist.
